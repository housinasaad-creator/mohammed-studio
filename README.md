# MOHAMMED · Web Studio

The studio's site (Arabic / English / Turkish): a 3D scroll hero, a projects page with a short looping clip from inside every site, and a case page per project with an explanation, screenshots (motion, 3D models, the cursor at work, interface) and phone shots.

- Pages: `index.html` (home), `projects.html` (all projects, real work and showcases), `work.html?id=...` (project case page).
- No frameworks. three.js is vendored in `js/vendor`; the hero scene, the three interactive motion samples (coffee roast, twelve hours of a fragrance on skin, melting chocolate) and everything else are generated in code.
- Nothing off-screen runs: the 3D scene loads after the page, pauses when out of view and drops its resolution if frames get slow; videos load only when they approach the viewport, pause when hidden and are released when far away; posters stand in under `prefers-reduced-motion` or data-saver.
- The layout stays left-to-right in all languages; Arabic text is ordered right-to-left inside its own block.

Text, links and the project list live in `js/content.js`; per-project explanations in `js/cases.js`.
